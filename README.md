# ✅ FocusFlow

**FocusFlow** is a simple and modern checklist application that I built to help myself stay consistent, productive, and focused throughout my day. It lets you create your daily tasks, check them off as you go, and keep your workflow flowing — every day.

## ✨ Why I Built This

I created **FocusFlow** to improve my consistency and help build strong daily habits. Each morning, I use it to list my important tasks, and throughout the day, I strike them off one by one. It’s my personal tool for staying intentional, organized, and productive.
